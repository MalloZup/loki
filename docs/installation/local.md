# Installing Loki Locally

## Release Binaries

Every [Loki release](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases) includes
prebuilt binaries:

```bash
# download a binary (modify app, os, and arch as needed)
# Installs v0.3.0. Go to the releases page for the latest version
$ curl -fSL -o "/usr/local/bin/loki.gz" "https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/download/v0.3.0/loki_linux_amd64.gz"
$ gunzip "/usr/local/bin/loki.gz"

# make sure it is executable
$ chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/loki"
```

## Community openSUSE Linux packages

If you use openSUSE Linux you can install packaged version of Loki with:

1) Add the repository `https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/logging/` to your system. 
   E.g if you are using Leap 15.1 use `sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/logging/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/security:logging.repo ; sudo zypper ref`

2) Install package with `zypper in loki`

3) Enable services:

-  `systemd start loki` and `systemd enable loki`
-  `systemd start promtail` and `systemd enable promtail`

4) Adapt the configuration files:

`/etc/loki/promtail.yaml`
`/etc/loki/loki.yaml`

## Manual Build
